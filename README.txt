  Translate AS1
-----------------
The Translate framework is a collection of classes used to implement a compiler 
for Macromedia's ActionScript language, Version 1.x.

  Licensing
-------------
Translate AS1 is made available under the terms of the Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) license. This allow you complete freedom to use and
distribute the code in source and/or binary form as long as you respect
the original copyright. Please see the LICENCE.txt file for exact terms.

The class libraries shipped with Translate each have their own licence. For more
details please see the 'Libraries' section below.

----------------
  Requirements
----------------

To use the Translate you must have:

    Java 2 Standard Edition
    
All other libraries are included in the release.

-------------------------
  Testing the Framework
-------------------------
Translate comes with code to test the compiler with a reference suite of 
ActionScript code. 

The ActionScript code samples passed to the compiler can be found in the 
directory test/data/as1. Each file implements a specific subset of the 
ActionScript language, e.g. literals, Number class methods, binary operators, 
etc.

There are also three Flash files, Button.fla, Frame.fla and MovieClip.fla. The
ActionScript code are #included in each file so the code can be part of a 
complete Flash movie. This allows the code generated by Translate to be compared
against the code generated by Macromedia's authoring tool.

The 'test' target runs two suites, ASParserReference followed by ASParser. The 
ASParserReference suite uses the TextDump tool from the Transform Framework to 
create human readable versions of the Flash files in test/data/as1 (the files
are written to the same directory). Next the ASParser suite compiles the 
Actionscript files and writes the generated Flash files to the directory,
test/results/ASParser/as1. This suite also runs the TextDump tool on the 
generated files. The text files in the two directories can then be compared to 
see whether the code generated by Translate matches the code in the test data 
files.

Running the ASParserReference suite each time is unnecessary. Instead the Ant 
target 'suite-test' can be selected. When prompted enter ASParserReference -
this suite only needs to be run once. After that the target can be rerun giving
ASParser when prompted.

IMPORTANT: Most of the files are identical to the code generated by Macromedia
Flash. However a few are not byte-for-byte comparable. When finding any 
differences it is important that the differences may still be logically 
equivalent. For more information contact Flagstone, see Addtional Information
at the end of this note.

  Libraries
-------------
Translate AS1 is distributed with the following libraries:

    * JavaCC from Sun MicroSystems  
    * JUnit, http://www.junit.org/
    
JavaCC is used to generate the classes from the ActionScript grammar that are 
used to constructor the compiler.

JUnit is used to run the test suites that are used to verify that the code 
generated by Translte is compatible with code generated by Macromedia Flash.

These libraries are not covered by the licence associated with Translate.
