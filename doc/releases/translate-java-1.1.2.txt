  Release Notes for Translate AS1 1.1.2
-----------------------------------------

Version 1.1.2 is a maintenance release with two minor bug fixes. The name of 
the JAR file has been changed to translate-dev.jar. The "-dev" suffix reflects 
that the package is the Developer Edition.

NOTE: This release requires Transform SWF 1.3 to run.

1. What bugs have been fixed ?

  Fixed a bug when using the new keyword to create objects.

  Updated code to generate correct request types functions that generate 
  GetUrl2 actions.


1.1 new keyword now generates correct code.

In previous releases using the new keyword to create an object: 

    anObject = new Ship();

would generate code containing an NamedObject action when the object was one of 
the built-in classes in Actionscript and a NewObject action for user-defined 
classes. This was incorrect a <em>NamedObject</em> is generated in all cases.

1.2 Correct request types are now generated for the GetUrl2 action.

Several functions generate code that contain the GetUrl2 action. With the 
release of Transform SWF 1.3 three, previously unsupported, request types have 
been added and the existing ones renamed to better reflect their function. The 
code generated by the following Actionscript functions has been updated to 
support the new request types:

    getURL()
    fscommand()
    loadMovie()
    loadVariables()
    print()
    printAsBitmap()

It is possible that code generated with earlier releases contains subtle bugs 
caused by the incorrect request type being used. However none have been revealed 
in testing carried out so far.
