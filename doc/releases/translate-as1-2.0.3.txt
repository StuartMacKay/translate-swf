  Bug Fixes  
-------------

1. The legacy function, random(), is now supported.

The Actionscript function, random(), was replaced in Flash 5 by Math.random(). 
Support was added for completeness.

2. Unary operators can now be used on object attributes.

Attributes on objects can now be used with any of the unary operations: pre or 
post increment (++), pre or post decrement (--), logical not (!) or bitwise 
not (~). For example:

var obj = new Object();

obj.foo++;
++obj.foo;


3. Arguments for anonymous functions are now supported.

The code for anonymous functions:

a = function(x, y) {
   b = x;
   c = y;
}

now correctly creates the list of arguments to the NewFunction action so the 
values are accessible within the function body. 

4. Variables with local scope are supported.

The scoping of local variables defined using the var keyword is now correct:

var i = 1;

if (i == 1) 
{
   var i = 0;
   
   trace(i);
}

will correctly report the value of the "innermost" variable i and display the 
value of 0.

5. String literals are now encoded correctly.

String literals that contain characters whose codes require more than 1 byte
can now be used in string literals and identifier.

-----------------
  Class Changes  
-----------------

1. The encoding for characters sets can now be specified.

The following methods:

    ASParser.java
        public ASNode parse(String script, String encoding) throws ParseException;
        public ASNode parse(File file, String encoding) throws ParseException;

    ASNode.java
        public byte[] encode(int version, String encoding);


were added to allow the character encoding used in the actionscript code to be 
specified. Previously releases assumed that all scripts were encoded as UTF-8.
