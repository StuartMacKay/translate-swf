  Release Notes for Translate AS1 for Java, Version 1,1.
------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1 is a maintenance release albeit a significant one. The grammar 
used to parse scripts has been completely overhauled and now supports all of 
the language constructs and functions provided in Macromedia's Flash 5 
ActionScript language.

1. New Language Constructs Supported

Support has been added for the following keywords, statements and functions:

  * null objects are now supported.
  * the for..in statement, which iterates over an objects attributes, has been 
    added.
  * the Boolean(), String() and Number() functions are supported.
  * user-defined functions can now be treated as objects.


2. Differences with Macromedia's ActionScript</h2>

The is one difference in the version of ActionScript supported by Translate SWF 
when compared with Macromedia's Flash Authoring Tool. In the Authoring Tool the 
concept of Scenes is supported for splitting long animations into more manageable 
sections. Scenes are only supported by the Authoring Tool and are not part of 
the Flash file format specification. Translate SWF does not support Scenes which 
results in the following differences with Macromedia's ActionScript:

ActionScript                 Support in Translate SWF
gotoAndPlay(scene, frame)    the scene argument is optional.
gotoAndStop(scene, frame)    the scene argument is optional.
nextScene()                  generates code to move to frame 0.</td></tr>
prevScene()                  generates code to move to frame 0.</td></tr>


3. What bugs have been fixed ?

In addition to added language constructs, the following known bugs were fixed:

  * the radix argument of the parseInt() function is now optional. If omitted a 
    default radix of 10 is assumed.
  * rvalue statements now correctly pop the unused value from the stack.

With the revised grammar the syntax of scripts is more robust: iterator 
statements (for, while, do..while) now support statement bodies containing a 
single statement; multi-level de-referencing of an object's attributes is now 
supported - previously only one-level, e.g. a.b was supported.>

4. Class Changes

The following sections describe the changes, methods added and bugs fixed for 
each class.

4.1. Pkg

  * The reportPackageInformation(boolean showLicense) method which was used to 
    report information about either the Translate SWF package or any application 
    using the package has been deprecated. The method now prints out information 
    about the package. This code will be moved in to the main(String[] args) 
    method at a future date.
