  Release Notes for Translate AS1 1.1.1
-----------------------------------------

Version 1.1.1 is a maintenance release fixing a serious bug in array 
subscripting and added support for run-time evaluation of array, function 
and object names.</P>

1. What bugs have been fixed ?

  Array elements can now be assigned values.
  Evaluating names of functions is now supported.


1.1 Array elements can now be assigned values.</H3>

Release 1.1 would not allow values to be assigned to an array element, e.g.: 

    a[1] = 4;

Resulting in an FSParseException being thrown. This is now fixed.>

1.2 Evaluating names of functions is now supported.

The name of a function or object can now be generated at run-time:

    function echo(value)
    {
        return value;
    }
    
    a = eval("echo")("A message");
    a = this["echo"]("A message");

This is useful in implementing a lookup table for executing functions. Instead 
of:

    if (value == "a")
	    afunc();
    else if (value == "b")
        bfunc();
    else if (value == "c")
        cfunc();

This code can be replaced with:
 
    this[ value + "func"]();
