    * Updated the grammar and ASNode to add:
    
        try..catch blocks
        throw operator
        
    * Removed support for #initclip/#endinitclip from the parser. These are 
      best handled by compiling scripts then adding the compiled actions to an
      FSInitialize object. 
      
    * Added actions for Greater, StringGreater, Extends and EnumerateObject.
    
    * Added ExceptionHandler class.
    
    * Corrected serious bug in encode() method where Flash version number was 
      not being set correctly - this meant that OnClipEvent() statements were
      only being encoded correctly for Flash 5.
      
    * Started adding code generation for different versions of Flash.
    
    * Turned off validation of node trees until a better mechanism is 
      implemented.

    * WaitForframe2 actions are now encoded with the correct length.
    
    * 'and' and 'or' operators now generate different code from && and ||.
    
    * fixed bugs in generating code in the functions printNum, printAsBitmapNum, 
      ifFrameLoaded, === and !==.

    Cumulative changes performed since the last release:
    
    * Updated the grammar and ASNode to add:
    
        statements:
    
            switch..case..default
            try..catch..finally
            throw
            
        directives:
        
            #initclip, #endinitclip
        
        operators:
        
            === strict equals (flash 6)
            !== strict not equals (flash 6)
            and logical and (flash 4)
            or  logical or (flash 4)
            add string add (flash 4)
            eq  equals (flash 4)
            ne  not equals (flash 4)
            le  less than or equal (flash 4)
            gt  greater than (flash 4)
            ge  greater than or equal (flash 4)
            
        functions:
        
            ifFrameLoaded()
            tellTarget()
            
            attachAudio()
            call()
            chr()
            getTimer()
            int()
            mbchr()
            mbord()
            mbsubstring()
            ord()
            printNum()
            printAsBitmapNum()
            substring()
            unloadMovieNum()
            
        constants:
        
            newline
            undefined
    
    * Corrected bug in reporting line numbers and filenames when a parse 
      exception occurs.
      
    * Fixed a bug in the grammar when handling negative interger literals.
    
    * Objects can be created without having to create an argument list:
    
        x = new Object;
        
    * fixed bug that caused an exception when decoding strings into bytes. This
      bug only occured in simple scripts where the Table object containing 
      strings was not used.
              
    * Replaced the test classes ASParserTest and ASParseReference with a single
      class Actionscript. The corresponding test suites were replaced by 
      individual suites for each version of flash.
      
    * ASNode:translate() no longer throws an IllegalArgumentException if the
      version of Flash to encode the node tree is less than 5.
      
    * Delete now correctly distinguishes between an object or a member variable.
    
    * Arguments passed to the built-in functions gotoAndPlay and gotoAndStop are
      now correctly added to the table of strings.
      
    * gotoAndPlay and gotoAndStop generate the correct action when executed 
      in a movie clip.
      
    * Testing is now performed for each major version of Flash. Test suites 
      have been added for SWF5, SWF6 and SWF7.
      
    * Actionscript.java now decodes existing Flash files to add the actions
      compiled by Translate. This ensures that the test reference files and 
      compiler generated files are identical and speeds up regression testing.

    * The built-in function updateAfterEvent() can now be called with no
      arguments.

    * Arguments for anonymous functions are now correctly passed to the 
      code in the body of a function.
    * Variables with local scope are supported - this was fixed in 2.0.2 but
      only verified in the testing for 2.0.3
    
2006-06-11 - smackay@flagstonesoftware.com

    * Resolved ambiguity in parent class name for Interpreter - the Tool class
      is defined in Transform as well as Translate.

      architecture resulting in code which is much smaller and faster than
      the previous release.
