  Translate AS1
-----------------
The Translate framework is a collection of classes used to implement a compiler 
for Macromedia's ActionScript language, Version 1.x.

  Licensing
-------------
Translate AS1 is made available under the terms of the GNU General Public License. 
Please see the LICENSE.txt file for exact terms.

The class libraries shipped with Translate each have their own licence. For more
details please see the 'Libraries' section below.

  Requirements
----------------

To use the Translate you must have:

    Java 2 Standard Edition

-------------
  Libraries
-------------
Translate AS1 is distributed with the following libraries:

    * JavaCC from Sun MicroSystems
    
    * Transform SWF from Flagstone Software Ltd.
    
JavaCC is used to generate the classes from the ActionScript grammar that are 
used to constructor the compiler.

Transform is only included so the TextDump tool can be used to easily compare
the code generated by Translate against code generated by Macromedia's Flash.

These libraries are not covered by the licence associated with Translate.

  Testing the Framework
-------------------------
Translate comes with code to test the compiler with a reference suite of 
ActionScript code. The tests use the TestNG framework developed by Cedric Beust, 
http://www.testng.org.

To run the tests you will need to download the latest version of the TestNG from
www.testng.org. Two versions of TestNG are available for Java 1.4 and Java 1.5
depending on which version of Java you are using. Place the testNG jar file in
the lib directory of the Translate framework.

The Ant build file, test.xml, contains the following targets to run the tests:

	clean-test  delete all the test reports and any directories generated when
	            running the tests.
	           
	build-test  compile the test classes.
	
    test        run a full test of all the classes in the framework.
    
    test-class  run a selected test suite.
    
The reports generated by TestNG are written to the directory test/reports. A 
separate directroy is created for each test and is named after the class being
test while the report generated while testing the entire framework is written
to the directory, Transform.

The ActionScript code samples passed to the compiler can be found in the 
directory test/data/as1. Each file implements a specific subset of the 
ActionScript language, e.g. literals, Number class methods, binary operators, 
etc.

There are also three Flash files, Button.fla, Frame.fla and MovieClip.fla. The
ActionScript code are #included in each file so the code can be part of a 
complete Flash movie. This allows the code generated by Translate to be compared
against the code generated by Macromedia's authoring tool.

Generating reference file using these Flash files forms the basis of testing.
First run the TestNG script ASParserReference.xml. This generates a text file 
containing a human readable representation of the Flash file using the TextDump
tool from the Transform Framework. Next run the suite ASParser.xml - using the 
'test' target in the Ant file, text.xml. This compiles the code and generates 
a text file in the directory test/results/ASParser/as1. The text files in the 
two directories can then be compared to see whether the code generated by 
Translate is valid.
