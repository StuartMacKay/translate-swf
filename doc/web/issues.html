<h2>Current Issues</h2>

<H3>1501763. Newline does not delimit statements</H3>

<P>The parser in Macromedia Flash allows newline characters to delimit 
statements. The statements:

<pre>
    a = 1
    b = 2
</pre>
<P>are valid ActionScript however Translate requires explicit semi-colons to
terminate a statement, e.g.

<pre>
    a = 1;
    b = 2;
</pre>

<H4>Root Cause</H4>

<P>The parser rules recognize newlines as whitespace rather than as statement 
delimiters.</P>

<H4>Workaround</H4>

<P>There is no workaround. All statements must be terminated with a semi-colon. 
Block statements such as those which form the body of an if or for statement are
not affected.</P>

<H4>When will it be fixed?</H4>

<P>This is a tough one to fix. Several different ways of preprocessing the 
script to replace line-breaks with semi-colons have been examined. None gave 
simple or consistent results.</P>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1616266. duplicate definitions in event handlers.</H3>

<P>When compiling the code for button and movie clip event handlers:

<pre>
    on(mouseDown)
    {
        function fn(x) {
           return getPropery(x)+1;
        }
        
        xLocation = fn("_x");
    }
    
    on (mouseUp)
    {
    	yLocation = _y + 1;
    }  
</pre>

<P>the definitions for functions and the table of strings defined in the handler
for mouseDown events will be repeated in the definition of the event handler 
for mouseUp events even though they are not used.</P>

<H4>Root Cause</H4>

<P>The root cause is a failure to empty the table of defined strings and 
function each time the code for an event handler is compiled.</P>

<H4>Workaround</H4>

<P>There is no simple workaround. The affect is only to increase the size of the
compiled code by including unused strings and function definitions. In an event 
handler, any function or string with the same name will simply overwrite the 
previous entry in the table so the code will be unaffected by any existing
entries.</P>

<H4>When will it be fixed?</H4>

<P>A fix is planned for release 2.0.5 due at the end of December 2006.</P>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1616257. for..in statements do not support var keyword.</H3>

<P>for..in statements that use the var keyword will cause a parse exception to 
be thrown.</p>

<pre>
    for (var a in b) 
</pre>

<H4>Root Cause</H4>

<P>The code to support the keyword was added to the grammar in the latest 
release (2.0.4) however the test scripts (which were also being updated) did
not include a test to verify that the grammar change worked.</P>

<H4>Workaround</H4>

<P>The workaround is simply to omit the var keyword.</P>

<H4>When will it be fixed?</H4>

<P>A fix is planned for release 2.0.5 due at the end of December 2006.</P>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1616274. on() and onclipevent() statements are not interchangeable.</H3>

<p>The on() and onclipevents() can be used in Macromedia flash to define the 
event handlers in buttons and movie clips. The application provides the context 
(events are bound to a physical object) and so the statements can be used 
interchangeable to define the event handlers for an object.</p>

<p>This is not possible with Translate since the scripts are compiled as stand-alone 
code so the different types of statement are important to determine which data 
structures should be generated for the compiled code.</p>

<H4>Root Cause</H4>

<P>The root cause is the design of the ASParser class which uses a single 
method to compile the different types of scripts.</P>

<H4>Workaround</H4>

<P>There is no workaround. The on() statment must be used to define event
handlers for buttons and onClipEvent() must be used to define event handlers
for movie clips.</P>

<H4>When will it be fixed?</H4>

<P>It is not clear how this can be fixed unless the API is change to provide 
methods to explicitly compile scripts for the different types of object.</P>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1616292. function names are case sensitive.</H3>

<p>when referencing built-in functions such as gotoAndStop the name used in 
Translate is case-sensitive. In Macromedia flash the function names are ~
case insensitive. This means that</p>

<pre>
    gotoAndStop();
    gotoandstop();
</pre>

<p>
are treated a two different functions. The first function is recognized by 
Translate as a reference to the built-in Flash function while the second is not 
- instead it is treated as a call to a user-defined function.</p>

<H4>Root Cause</H4>

<P>The ASNode class contains a table of built-in function names. This table is
searched using a case-sensitive comparison.</P>

<H4>Workaround</H4>

<P>There is no workaround.</P>

<H4>When will it be fixed?</H4>

<P>This will be fixed as soon as possible. Not release is currently set since 
this also requires a new set of test scripts to be written.</P>

<br/>

<H2>Recently Fixed</H2>

<H3>1560065. updateAfterEvent() cannot be called with no arguments.</H3>

<P>The built-in function, updateAfterEvent() can now be used without passing an
argument.

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1465622. Variables with local scope are not supported.</H3>

<P>Local variables arenow scoped correctly.</P>

<pre>
    var i = 1;

    if (i == 1) {
       var i = 0;
    }

    trace(i);
</pre>

<p>Will now print the correct value '1'.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<h3>1465637. Accented Characters not supported.</h3>

<P>Non ASCII characters in strings no longer cause errors:

<PRE>
   var str = &quot;Il y a un probl&egrave;me&quot;;
</PRE>
   
<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<h3>1465635. Anonymous function arguments are not assigned to variables.</H3>

<P>When an anonymous function is assigned to a variable then the arguments
passed to the function are correctly bound to the function variables:

<pre>
   foo = function(x) {
       trace(&quot;x=&quot; + x)   
   };

   foo(&quot;hello&quot;);
</pre>

<p>Produces the result:</p>

<pre>
   &quot;x=hello&quot;   
</pre>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1465629. Incrementing object attributes fails.</H3>

<P>UNary operators such as pre/post increment and pre/post descrement can now
be used with object attributes.</P>

<pre>
    obj.foo++;
    ++obj.foo;
</pre>
 
<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1465623. random() function is not supported.</H3>

<P>The function random() can now be used in scripts.</p> 

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<h3>1465612. instanceof is not currently supported.</H3>

<P>The instanceof operator can now be used to test class membership</P>

<pre>
    var a = new MyClass();

    if (a instanceof MyClass) {
        ...
    }
</pre>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<h3>1465613. delete operator is not currently supported.</h3>

<P>The delete operator can be used to delete an object:</P>

<pre>
    var a = new MyClass();

    delete a;
</pre>

<div class="hr"><hr/></div>

<H3>1465620. Multiple assignments are not supported.</H3>

<P>The value of more than one variable can be set in an assignment statement:</P>

<pre>
    var a = b = c = 1;
</pre>
